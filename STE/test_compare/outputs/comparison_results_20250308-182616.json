It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sleepy'], references=[['the cat is very happy today', 'the cat is very happy now'], ['the dog is very sleepy now', 'the dog is very sleepy yesterday']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, and the BLEU scores for these predictions: predictions=['the house is blue', 'the apple is red'], references=[['the house is blue and big', 'the house is old'], ['the apple is red and juicy', 'the apple is sweet']], max_order=3, smooth=True, and the BERTScore for these predictions: predictions=['the sun is shining brightly', 'the sun is shining in the sky'], references=[['the sun is shining brightly in the sky', 'the sun is shining brightly today'], ['the sun is shining in the sky and the dog is happy', 'the sun is shining in the sky and the dog is sad']], lang='en', idf=True?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat is the proportion of correctly classified samples in my model when I have predicted labels [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] and the actual labels are [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] with sample weights [0.5, 0.2, 0.9, 0.1, 0.6, 0.4] and I want to get the fraction of correctly classified samples, but I only consider the samples where the predicted label is not equal to the actual label and the sample weight is greater than 0.3, and I also want to normalize the result?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 8 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky']] and the predictions ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog slowly'] against the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the new car is very expensive', 'the latest car is a great device'], references=[['the new car is a costly item', 'the latest car is a fantastic device'], ['the new car is affordable', 'the latest car is okay']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, and the BLEU scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the sun rises over the ocean', 'the waves crash on the shore'], references=[['the sun is shining brightly over the sea', 'the waves are crashing on the beach'], ['the ocean is calm', 'the shore is quiet']], max_order=4, smooth=False?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the new car is very expensive', 'the latest car is a great device'], references=[['the new car is a costly item', 'the latest car is a fantastic device'], ['the old car is very affordable', 'the old car is not great']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, max_order=4, smooth=True, idf=False, lang='en' and the BERTScore and BLEU scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the sun rises over the ocean', 'the waves crash on the shore'], references=[['the sun is shining brightly over the sea', 'the waves are crashing on the beach'], ['the ocean is calm', 'the shore is quiet']], use_stemmer=True, smooth=False, lang='en'?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-W-1 scores with use_stemmer=true and use_aggregator=false, as well as the BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for these four generated summaries: \"The company is planning to launch a new product line\", \"The product will be a major success\", \"The product will be released soon\", \"The company is investing heavily in research and development\" with \"Product announcement 1\", \"Product announcement 2\", \"Product announcement 3\", \"Product announcement 4\" as references, and the BLEU score with max_order=5 and smooth=false, and BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for the following generated summaries: \"The new product is expected to be a huge hit\", \"The product will be launched next quarter\", \"The company is making a significant investment in marketing\", \"The product will be a game-changer in the industry\"?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sleepy'], references=[['the cat is very happy today', 'the cat is very happy now'], ['the dog is very sleepy now', 'the dog is very sleepy yesterday']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, and the BLEU scores for these predictions: predictions=['the house is blue', 'the apple is red'], references=[['the house is blue and big', 'the house is old'], ['the apple is red and juicy', 'the apple is sweet']], max_order=3, smooth=True, and the BERTScore for these predictions: predictions=['the sun is shining brightly', 'the sun is shining in the sky'], references=[['the sun is shining brightly in the sky', 'the sun is shining brightly today'], ['the sun is shining in the sky and the dog is happy', 'the sun is shining in the sky and the dog is sad']], lang='en', idf=True?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 8 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rougeL', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is shining in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky']] and the predictions ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog slowly'] against the references [['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore of the following pairs of texts: predictions=['The new smartphone has a great camera and a long battery life', 'The latest smartphone release has received overwhelmingly positive reviews']; references=[['The new smartphone has a great camera and a long battery life', 'The latest smartphone release has received overwhelmingly positive reviews'], ['The new smartphone has a good camera but a small battery', 'The latest smartphone release is a disappointment for its price'], ['The new smartphone has a great battery life and a good camera', 'The latest smartphone release has received mixed reviews'], ['The new smartphone has a great camera and a long battery life', 'The latest smartphone release has received overwhelmingly positive reviews']]; rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rougeLsum']; idf=true; lang=en; use_aggregator=true; use_stemmer=false?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nHow do the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator set to true, and use_stemmer set to false change when the maximum n-gram order is increased from 2 to 4, and smoothing is disabled, for the predictions ['the quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['the quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['the cat is sitting on the mat', 'the cat is laying on the mat']] and the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'a cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running', 'the cat is sleeping'], ['a fast brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'a fast brownish fox jumps over the sleepy dog']] and the predictions ['a cat is sleeping', 'the dog is barking'] against the references [['a cat is sleeping soundly', 'the dog is barking loudly'], ['a fast brown fox is jumping quickly', 'a fast brownish fox is jumping slowly']]?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-W-1 scores with use_stemmer=true and use_aggregator=false, as well as the BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for these four generated summaries: \"The company is planning to launch a new product line\", \"The product will be a major success\", \"The product will be released soon\", \"The company is investing heavily in research and development\" with \"Product announcement 1\", \"Product announcement 2\", \"Product announcement 3\", \"Product announcement 4\" as references, and the BLEU score with max_order=5 and smooth=false, and BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for the following generated summaries: \"The new product is expected to be a huge hit\", \"The product will be launched next quarter\", \"The company is making a significant investment in marketing\", \"The product will be a game-changer in the industry\"?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the perplexities of the following group of texts: \"The sun sets slowly over the ocean.\", \"The sky turns pink and orange.\", \"The world is full of tranquility.\", \"The seagulls fly overhead.\", \"The smell of saltwater fills the air.\" and \"The stars shine brightly in the evening sky.\", \"The world is full of wonder.\", \"The flowers bloom in every color.\", \"The baby laughs at the bubbles.\", \"The kids play with the ball.\", \"The world is full of joy.\" using the gpt2 model?",
