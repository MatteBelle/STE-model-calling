It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the following predictions and references, including rouge1 and rougeL, and return individual scores for each prediction-reference pair, for the following predictions and references with multiple references per prediction, and also calculate the BERTScore with and without inverse document frequency reweighting, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is very happy', 'The dog is very sad'], references=[['The cat is happy', 'the dog is sad'], ['The cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sad', 'the cat is sad']], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=[['The quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog', 'leaps over the lazy dog']], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=[['The sun is shining', 'the dog is running'], ['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']], lang='en', max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=False, idf=True",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BERTScore with idf true, the ROUGE scores (rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, rougeLsum) with use_aggregator false and use_stemmer false, and the BLEU score with max_order 3 for the following predictions and references: predictions = ['The cat is sleeping', 'The dog is running'], references = ['The cat is sleeping on the mat', 'The dog is running quickly and quickly again'].",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: accuracy, exact_match, recall, f1\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: accuracy\n  Description: Accuracy computes the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions, and is widely used for classification tasks.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: Predicted labels\n    - references: Ground truth labels.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - normalize: If set to false, returns the number of correctly classified samples. Otherwise, returns the fraction of correctly classified samples\n    - sample_weight: Predicted labels\n\nMetric name: exact_match\n  Description: Exact Match computes the percentage of predictions that exactly match the reference answers, a common metric in question answering and similar tasks.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of predicted texts.\n    - references: List of reference texts.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - regexes_to_ignore: Regex expressions of characters to ignore when calculating the exact matches.\n    - ignore_case: If true, turns everything to lowercase so that capitalization differences are ignored.\n    - ignore_numbers (bool): If true, removes all digits before comparing strings\n    - ignore_punctuation (bool): If true, removes punctuation before comparing strings.\n\nMetric name: recall\n  Description: Recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified (Recall = TP / (TP + FN)), indicating the model's sensitivity.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: Predicted labels.\n    - references: Ground Truth labels.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - average: This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets. If None, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this determines the type of averaging performed on the data (e.g., 'binary', 'macro', 'micro', 'weighted', 'samples').\n    - labels: The set of labels to include when average is not set to 'binary', and the order of the labels if average is None.\n    - pos_label: The class to be considered the positive class, in the case where average is set to binary.\n    - sample_weight: Sample weights.\n\nMetric name: f1\n  Description: The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a classifier's performance, especially when classes are imbalanced.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The *N* predicted labels.\n    - references: The *N* true labels.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - average: The averaging method to use (e.g., 'macro', 'micro', 'weighted').\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the exact match scores of a model that predicted the following city names: 'Paris', 'Rome', 'Berlin', 'London', 'Madrid', and the true city names are 'Paris', 'Rome', 'Amsterdam', 'London', 'Barcelona' respectively, ignoring case, numbers, and punctuation, and what are the recall and F1 scores of the model when the predicted labels are [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] and the true labels are [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] with the F1 score averaged macroscopically, and what are the recall scores with labels [2, 1, 1, 0, 1] and sample weights [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] and what are the accuracy and F1 scores of the model when the average is set to'micro'?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores of the generated summaries [\"the cat is very happy today\", \"the dog is very sad\"] compared to the references [\"the cat is very happy today\", \"the dog is very happy today\"], [\"the cat is very sad today\", \"the dog is very sad today\"] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator on, and stemming off, and what are the BLEU scores with max_order 4, smooth on, and BERTScore in English with idf on of the generated summaries [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky\"] compared to the references [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky\"], [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the fast dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the dark blue sky\"]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 7 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the fox jumps over the lazy dog']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky with a few white clouds']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references, including rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, and rougeLsum, and return aggregated scores, without stemming, for the following predictions and references with exactly one reference per prediction, and also calculate the BLEU score with a maximum order of 4 and without smoothing, and calculate the BERTScore with inverse document frequency reweighting, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is sitting on the mat', 'The dog is very happy'], references=['The cat is sitting on the mat', 'The cat is happy'], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=['The sun is shining', 'The dog is running'], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=['The quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], lang='en', max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=True",

BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores, as well as the BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for these three generated summaries: \"The latest news on the economy is that the market is up\", \"The economy is experiencing a significant downturn\", \"The market is volatile\" with \"The latest news on the economy is that the market is up, but there are concerns about inflation\" as a reference, and \"The economy is experiencing a significant downturn due to the pandemic\" and \"The market is volatile and unpredictable\" and \"The market is expected to recover slowly\" as references, using ROUGE types=['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, BLEU scores with max_order=5 and smooth=true, and BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for the following generated summaries: \"The company is launching a new product\", \"The new product is a game-changer\", \"The product will be available soon\" with \"The company is launching a new innovative product\", \"The new product is a major breakthrough\", \"The product will be released soon\" as references?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BLEU scores for the following predictions and references, including rouge1 and rougeL, and return individual scores for each prediction-reference pair, for the following predictions and references with multiple references per prediction, and also calculate the BERTScore with and without inverse document frequency reweighting, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is very happy', 'The dog is very sad'], references=[['The cat is happy', 'the dog is sad'], ['The cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sad', 'the cat is sad']], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=[['The quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog', 'leaps over the lazy dog']], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=[['The sun is shining', 'the dog is running'], ['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly', 'the sun is shining']], lang='en', max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=False, idf=True",

It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores of the generated summaries [\"the cat is very happy today\", \"the dog is very sad\"] compared to the references [\"the cat is very happy today\", \"the dog is very happy today\"], [\"the cat is very sad today\", \"the dog is very sad today\"] with ROUGE types ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'], aggregator on, and stemming off, and what are the BLEU scores with max_order 4, smooth on, and BERTScore in English with idf on of the generated summaries [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky\"] compared to the references [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky\"], [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the fast dog\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the dark blue sky\"]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair.

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores with rouge_types ['rouge1', 'rougeL'], aggregator on, and stemming on of the generated summaries [\"the cat is playing with a ball\", \"the dog is running quickly\"] compared to the references [\"the cat is playing with a toy\", \"the dog is running fast\"], [\"the cat is sleeping\", \"the dog is sitting\"], and [\"the cat is running with a ball\", \"the dog is running quickly\"], and what are the BLEU scores with max_order 4, smooth on, of the generated summaries [\"the quick brown fox\", \"the sun is shining brightly\"] compared to the references [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", \"the sun is shining in the sky\"], [\"the quick brown fox\", \"the sun is shining brightly in the morning\"?",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the BLEU scores with a maximum n-gram order of 7 and smoothing enabled, the ROUGE scores with rouge_types set to ['rouge1', 'rougeLsum'] and use_aggregator set to false, and the BERTScore with idf set to true, for the predictions ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'] against the references [['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly'], ['the dog is running quickly', 'the cat is sleeping soundly']] and the predictions ['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'] against the references [['a brown fox is quick', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], ['the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', 'the fox jumps over the lazy dog']] and the predictions ['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'] against the references [['the sun is shining brightly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky'], ['the sun is setting slowly in the clear blue sky', 'the sun is shining in the clear blue sky with a few white clouds']]?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores for the following predictions and references, including rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, and rougeLsum, and return aggregated scores, without stemming, for the following predictions and references with exactly one reference per prediction, and also calculate the BLEU score with a maximum order of 4 and without smoothing, and calculate the BERTScore with inverse document frequency reweighting, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is sitting on the mat', 'The dog is very happy'], references=['The cat is sitting on the mat', 'The cat is happy'], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=['The sun is shining', 'The dog is running'], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=['The quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], lang='en', max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=True",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BERTScore for the following predictions and references with exactly two references per prediction, and also calculate the BLEU score with a maximum order of 2 and without smoothing, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is very happy', 'The dog is very sad'], references=[['The cat is happy', 'the dog is sad'], ['The cat is very happy', 'the dog is very sad']], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=[['The quick brown fox', 'leaps over the lazy dog'], ['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog']], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=[['The sun is shining', 'the dog is running'], ['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly']], max_order=2, smooth=False",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE and BERTScore for the following predictions and references, including rouge1, rouge2, rougeL, and rougeLsum, and return individual scores for each prediction-reference pair, for the following predictions and references with exactly one reference per prediction, and also calculate the BLEU score with a maximum order of 2 and smoothing, and the METEOR score with a maximum order of 3 and without stemming, for the following predictions and references: predictions=['The cat is very happy', 'The dog is very sad'], references=['The cat is happy', 'The dog is very sad'], predictions=['The quick brown fox is very fast', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], references=['The quick brown fox', 'jumps over the lazy dog'], predictions=['The sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is running quickly'], references=['The sun is shining', 'the dog is running'], max_order=2, smooth=True, meteor_max_order=3, use_stemmer=False",

The result of the metric call will be returned starting with \"Evaluation Result\". *If the query requires multiple metrics call, then provide multiple Action and Action Input couples*\n\nReminder:\n1) The only values that should follow \"Action:\" are: bertscore, bleu, rouge\n2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments of each metric.\n\nAction Input:\n\\{\n    \"key_1\": \"value_1\",\n    ...\n    \"key_n\": \"value_n\",\n\\}\n\nAlways use the following answer format:\n \nAction: the evaluation metric name  \nAction Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format\n[...]\nAction: the Nth metric name\nAction input Nth related action input\n\n### Metrics documentation:\nMetric name: bertscore\n  Description: BERTScore uses contextual embeddings from a BERT model to evaluate the similarity between candidate and reference texts by computing cosine similarity over tokens.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: The generated sentences.\n    - references: The reference sentences.\n    - lang: The language of the input text (e.g., 'en' for English).\n  Optional parameters:\n    - idf: Whether to use inverse document frequency reweighting (default: false).\n\nMetric name: bleu\n  Description: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of *N* machine translation by comparing a candidate translation against *N* reference translations. It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores, as well as the BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for these three generated summaries: \"The latest news on the economy is that the market is up\", \"The economy is experiencing a significant downturn\", \"The market is volatile\" with \"The latest news on the economy is that the market is up, but there are concerns about inflation\" as a reference, and \"The economy is experiencing a significant downturn due to the pandemic\" and \"The market is volatile and unpredictable\" and \"The market is expected to recover slowly\" as references, using ROUGE types=['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator=true, use_stemmer=false, BLEU scores with max_order=5 and smooth=true, and BERTScore with idf=True and lang=en, for the following generated summaries: \"The company is launching a new product\", \"The new product is a game-changer\", \"The product will be available soon\" with \"The company is launching a new innovative product\", \"The new product is a major breakthrough\", \"The product will be released soon\" as references?",

It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore for the following predictions and references: predictions=['the new smartphone is a revolutionary device', 'the latest smartphone is very powerful'], references=[['the new smartphone is a game-changer', 'the latest smartphone is highly advanced'], ['the old smartphone is outdated', 'the old smartphone is not reliable']], rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=False, lang='en'?",

Defaults to 'numeric'.\n    - prompt_template: A custom prompt template to guide the LLM's evaluation process, if desired.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nHow do the scores for the following texts: \"The sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore was soothing.\", \"The smell of saltwater filled the air.\", \"The feeling of sand between my toes was invigorating.\" compare to the scores of the texts: \"The city was bustling with activity.\", \"The mountains stood tall and proud.\", \"The river flowed rapidly through the landscape.\" in terms of coherence, creativity, and relevance on a scale of 10, and also compare them to the scores of the texts: \"The text was poorly written.\", \"The text was poorly written.\", \"The text was poorly written.\" using the prompt template \"Please evaluate the quality of the text as a descriptive passage from a beach vacation\", and with the evaluation type set to \"numeric\"?",
