It computes the geometric mean of n-gram precisions with a brevity penalty to account for overly short translations. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating closer similarity to human translations.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: List of *N* translations to score\n    - references: list of *N* reference translations or a list of *N* lists of reference translations.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - max_order: Maximum n-gram order to consider (default: 4).\n    - smooth: Whether to apply smoothing (default: false).\n\nMetric name: rouge\n  Description: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a suite of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation. It measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and longest common subsequences between a generated text and one or more reference texts in a case-insensitive manner.\n  Required parameters:\n    - predictions: list of *N* predictions to score. Each prediction should be a string with tokens separated by spaces\n    - references: list of *N* references (one for prediction) or a list of *N* lists of references. Each reference should be a string with tokens separated by spaces.\n  Optional parameters:\n    - rouge_types: Types of ROUGE scores to compute. Defaults to ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum']. Valid types include: 'rouge1' (unigram), 'rouge2' (bigram), 'rougeL' (longest common subsequence), and 'rougeLsum' (LCS on concatenated summaries).\n    - use_aggregator: If true, returns aggregated scores; if false, returns individual scores for each prediction-reference pair. Defaults to true.\n    - use_stemmer: If true, applies a Porter stemmer to normalize words before comparison. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\n### User Query: \nWhat are the ROUGE scores of [\"The cat is very happy and playful\", \"The dog is very sad and lonely\"] against [\"The cat is extremely happy and playful\", \"The dog is very sad\", \"The cat is quite happy and playful\", \"The dog is not sad and lonely\"], the BERTScore precision, recall, and F1 scores with idf reweighting of [\"The cat is playing with a ball\", \"The dog is running quickly\"] against [\"The cat is playing with a toy\", \"The dog is running slowly\", \"The cat is playing with a toy\", \"The dog is running quickly\"], and the BLEU score with max_order 5 and smoothing of [\"The cat purrs on my lap\", \"The sun sets over the ocean\"] against [\"The cat purrs on my bed\", \"The sun sets over the sea\", \"The cat purrs on my chair\", \"The sun rises over the mountain\"], and the ROUGE scores of [\"The cat purrs on my lap\", \"The sun sets over the ocean\"] against [\"The cat purrs on my bed\", \"The sun sets over the sea\", \"The cat purrs on my chair\", \"The sun rises over the mountain\"], with rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL', 'rougeLsum'], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, and BLEU max_order 5 and smoothing?",
