You can synthesize another creative user query (it should differ from the previous one) to explore the metrics further and consolidate your understanding based on what you discovered. Remember that [...] is a placeholder I use for trimmed texts, so *don't* use [...] in your queries. Again, just input *one* user query alone; do NOT solve the query for now.\n**Parameters Mandatory Instructions**\n- For rouge: Do NOT include any optional parameters in your user query.\nIn case optional parameters ara asked to be included, the query must explicitly specify both the parameters and a chosen value.\n\nBelow are queries you have already explored and whether you successfully solved them with the API's help:\nQuery: \nWhat are the ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore for the following predictions and references: predictions = ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ], references = [['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ], ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ], [...] ], ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ], ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ], ['the sun is shining brightly', 'the dog is very big', [...] ]], use_aggregator=True, use_stemmer=False, rouge_types=['rouge1', 'rouge2', [...] ], max_order=4, smooth=False, idf=False?
