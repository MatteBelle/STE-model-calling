Your task is to answer the user's query as best you can. You have access to the following metric which you can use via API call to help with your response:

{api_descriptions}

Now you have the chance to explore the available APIs. You can do this by 1) synthesizing some natural user query that calling the API could help, and 2) trying to respond to the user query with the help of the APIs. Here, you can focus on queries that only require calling the API once.

Now, first input your synthesized user query. You should make the query natural, pretending to be a user that wants to measure a metric score from some texts he is providing as strings in the request. Input just the user query alone; do NOT solve the query for now.

User Query:
=========

Now, try to respond to the query using the available evaluation metrics.

The format you use for the evaluation metric is by specifying 1) Action: the name of the metric you want to call 2) Action Input: the input parameters for the metric in a JSON string format such that predictions and references have the same number of entries in their lists. The result of the metric call will be returned starting with "Evaluation Result:". Remember that you should only perform a SINGLE action at a time; do NOT return a list of multiple actions.

Reminder:
1) The only values that should follow "Action:" are: {metric_name}
2) Use the following JSON string format for the evaluation arguments.

Action Input:
{{
    "key_1": "value_1",
    ...
    "key_n": "value_n",
}}

Remember to ALWAYS use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do next  
Action: the evaluation metric name  
Action Input: the input parameters for the metric function in JSON string format  
Evaluation Result: the return result of the evaluation function. This is what I will provide you with; you do not need to repeat it in your response.  
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Evaluation Result cycle can repeat N times)  
Thought: I now know the final answer  
Final Answer: the response to the user query and some considerations on the result

Begin! Remember that your response should never start with "Evaluation Result:" since that is what I will provide you with. Once you have enough information, please immediately use \nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer:

User Query (the same you just synthesized): {query}

=========

Now you know a bit more about the available evaluation metrics. You can synthesize another user query to explore the metrics further and consolidate your understanding based on what you discovered. Again, just input the user query alone; do NOT solve the query for now.

User Query:

=========

Now try to solve the query using the evaluation metrics. Remember to follow the same format, i.e.,\nThought:\nAction:\nAction Input:\nEvaluation Result:\nFinal Answer:
